# Tuple are also a list but it is emmutable and this list can not be modified.

# Example of list
# numbers_1 = [1,2,3,4]
# print(numbers_1)
# print(type(numbers_1))
#
# # Example of Tuple
# numbers_2 = (1,2,3,4)
# print(numbers_1)
# print(type(numbers_2))

# Example for unpacking bt using list (All of the element must be unpacked)
# numbers = [1,2,3,4,6]
# x,y,z,m,n = numbers
# # x,y,z,m = numbers       # Show error (too many values to unpack (expected 4))
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)
# print(m)
# print(n)


# Example for unpacking bt using Tuple (All of the element must be unpacked)
# numbers = [1,2,3,4,6]
# x,y,z,m,n = numbers
# # x,y,z,m,n,s = numbers    # Show error (not enough values to unpack)
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)
# print(m)
# print(n)
